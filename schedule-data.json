This enables immersive real-life outbreak simulations that have been tested in hundreds of schools in the US and abroad. You can learn more about OO by checking this website: https://operationoutbreak.org/\r\nIn this talk, we will describe the prototype of a Godot-based port of the Operation Outbreak educational game. We started working on this prototype back in December of 2024, based on an initial exploration by a graduate intern in the Colubri lab, which were continued by two skilled Godot developers that joined the team after reading a posting about the project on the Godot forum. The prototype successfully implemented all the basic functionality of the real-life Operation Outbreak simulations, including contact detection, disease transmission, illness progression, resource management, etc. Furthermore, the Godot-based OO game reuses all the existing OO backend infrastructure, which makes it possible to read the same parameters that drive the phone-based simulations, store the resulting data in the same databases, and explore the data interactively with the web-based Outbreak Visualizer tool.\r\nWe are currently designing plans to pilot this prototype at schools in the US and abroad, to evaluate the engagement of students with this new educational game and collect their feedback. Based on the success of these plans in the coming months, we may be able to report preliminary results and insights during the talk.",

I'll advocate for the limiting the use of AI in shaders to discover what you don't know.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, I'll show that those of us who may struggle to draw may find an artistic expression through code.\r\n\r\nI'm an experienced conference speaker (in the open source, open standards, and javascript communities), so I know how quickly 25 minutes can go. My talk will be polished with good slides, and well practiced. I'll have additional materials for viewers to explore.",

Whether you’re building a small co-op game or a global multiplayer experience, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to succeed.",

                  "abstract": "## Bringing the Arcade to the Museum with Godot\r\n\r\nInterested in making physical games with Godot? In this lightning talk, Tyler and Annalivia discuss making SUPER ULTRA RACING XTREME, an arcade racing table, for the San Fransisco Museum of Modern Art. We'll break down the technical setup of the arcade table and its Godot integration, as well as the challenges of developing games for institutions and permanent display.\r\n\r\n## Log.gd, a Godot pretty-printer\r\n\r\nLog.gd is a drop-in `print(...)` replacement that formats and colorizes Godot data structures. It is focused on readable output and ergonomic call-sites.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at how this addon was implemented (spoiler alert, we wrap `print_rich()`, branch on the passed object type, and recurse!).\r\n\r\nWe'll see some of Log's features, including colors, supported data structures, spaces between arguments, not printing a million-billion items in your lists, and prepend the module and line-number in the output.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at some limitations, such as term-colors and the lack of a call-stack in production builds and threads.\r\n\r\nWe'll dream about future work and hope to inspire fancy versions of Godot's built-in print functions.\r\n\r\nFor the sticklers out there, I'll also mention that yes, you should be using the debugger, not print statements, to debug your code. But, you'll see that you still want a nice looking log when you run your game.\r\n\r\nYou can find more on Log.gd here: https://russmatney.github.io/log.gd/\r\n\r\n## Going Mobile with Godot\r\n\r\nHalf of all gaming revenue is on mobile, but most Godot developers do not target mobile.  This lightning talk will make the case that Godot developers should consider targeting mobile gamers, and will provide guidance on simple steps you can take to enable gamers on iOS and Android to enjoy your games.\r\n\r\n## Lessons from 25+ Game Jams with Godot\r\n\r\nI go over lessons learned from participating in 25+ jams with Godot, primarily for the Godot Wild Jam. \r\nhttps://itch.io/c/3319934/game-jam-titles\r\n\r\nThis will briefly touch on scoping, designing, development, production, motivation management, and team management.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Synths and Sound Design in Godot with Csound\r\n\r\nWhat if you could design and control custom synthesizers directly within Godot? godot-csound enables real-time sound synthesis, allowing developers to create procedural audio systems tailored to their games.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the technical process of writing synthesizers in Godot using godot-csound, from generating basic waveforms to designing more complex, interactive synths. We’ll explore how to send parameters from Godot to Csound, implement real-time control for dynamic sound variation, and optimize performance for game-ready audio synthesis.\r\n\r\nBest of all, godot-csound is free and open source, making it accessible for developers, composers, and audio enthusiasts alike. Whether you're building a dynamic soundtrack, interactive sound effects, or experimental audio systems, this session will serve as an introduction to creating custom synthesizers inside Godot.",

We are already working on other language support with our clients, which will be demonstrated during the talk.\r\n- LibGodot also enables embedding the Godot UI into the host application. UI embedding for iOS and Mac Catalyst is already available, and support for other platforms (MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Android) is already in progress and is planned to be included in Godot 4.5 and will be demonstrated during the talk.\r\n\r\nIn the talk, I will describe the features of LibGodot, its use cases both in Game and Application development, and show live demonstrations of some of them, including:\r\n- LibGodot allows enhancing mobile apps with interactive 2D and 3D content\r\n- LibGodot will enable .NET developers to start up Godot from their .NET application so they can use standard .NET tools for development\r\n- LibGodot can be used to provide complex 3D graphics capabilities in Qt apps\r\n- LibGodot can be used from Python scripts and enable complex automation workflows",

This easy-to-use plug-in presents a huge opportunity for the community to effortlessly create experiences based in the real-world and to stream tiled, LODed 3D data. In addition, the Godot community will be able contribute to this constantly evolving standard.\r\n### Focus\r\nThis talk will focus on the work done to integrate Cesium as a plugin for Godot, the challenges we encountered, and the solutions we developed. We will also share how we believe these learnings can influence the development of the engine to better accommodate data- and processing-intensive applications moving forward.\r\n### Technologies\r\n- GDExtension\r\n- Godot Engine submodules\r\n- C++ bindings\r\n- Cesium Native (3D tiles)\r\n- glTF\r\n\r\n**Speakers:** Leónidas Neftalí González & Andrés Botero",
